It is the best-preserved temple complex cut into a monolithic rock. It is believed to be the long-sought grave of the famous singer and Thracian ruler Orpheus. The complex is located 200 m from the village of Tatul in the localities of Kara Dere and Kaya Bash. (The archaeological site is at a distance of about 15 kilometers from the town of Momchilgrad).",

You can get there by a marked dirt road - through the villages of Gruevo and Letovnik. The name of the massif comes from the Turkish language damla - drop. The cold water of Dambala springs and flows from the rock itself. The beautiful fountain seems to add extra beauty to this holy place. Everyone believes that on the 5th and 6th of May St. George's Day /Huderlez/ the sky opens, the oak forest mysteriously makes noise and the clear water becomes alive, healing.",
    "DAMBALA_INFO_2": "From midnight to sunrise, the miraculous water of Dambala is the last hope and expected miracle for thousands of people who have come from different parts of the country and neighboring states. Parents dip their children in the small pool next to the two-story fountain. In the area of Dambala, many people pour water directly from the rock. On leaving, they tie part of their clothes to the trees - so that the disease remains there.",

    "PETRIFIED_FOREST_INFO": "The petrified forest is located in the territory of the village of Raven, Momchilgrad Municipality. Millions of years ago, there was an ancient forest and a tertiary sea here. When intense underwater volcanic activity began, part of the forest was buried by the volcanic material, and the high temperature charred whole trees or parts of them. Trees around 30 million years old are fossilized. What is unique about the Raven Petrified Forest is that the trees are upright. A phenomenon that has no analogue in world history."
